NEWTAB("II. Situation")
<br/><font color='#21749c' size='18' face='PuristaBold'>SUMMARY</font>
<br/>The Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, Studies and Observations Group (MACV-SOG) was activated, January 24, 1964, to function as a joint special operations task force. Commanded by a U.S. Army Special Forces colonel, MACV-SOG was a subcomponent of MACV, headquartered in Saigon.
<br/>
<br/>Born from a need to conduct more effective special operations against North Vietnam, many Central Intelligence Agency programs have been transferred to SOG, which now consisted of personnel from U.S. Army Special Forces, U.S. Navy Sea-Air-Land (SEALs), U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, Force Reconnaissance and CIA personnel.
<br/>
<br/>We are here to conduct special operations in North Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and South Vietnam. Personnel, infrastructure, assets and missions are ramping-up to support this new mission. SOG has been given the mission under OPLAN 34A to conduct strategic reconnaissance, direct action, sabotage, personnel recovery, Psychological Operations (PSYOP), counter-intelligence, and bomb damage assessments. Maritime operations, under the cover name of the Naval Advisory Detachment (NAD), is staffed by the Navy and their operations being launched from the Tien Sha Peninsula. They will operate along the coastal areas of North and South Vietnam.
<br/>
<br/>The Ho Chi Minh Trail, also called Annamite Range Trail is a logistical network of roads and trails that runs from the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (North Vietnam) to the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) through the kingdoms of Laos and Cambodia. The system provides support, in the form of manpower and materiel, to the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (called the Viet Cong or VC) and the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN), or North Vietnamese Army (NVA). 
<br/>
<br/>MACV Saigon thinks that the 1st, 3rd and/or 7th NVA Division/s have begun building-up forces and support infrastructure utilizing the Ho Chi Minh trail in preparation for an attack on Khe Sanh. Saigon thinks that the NVA have moved across the border into the Dong Dang Valley area.

<br/>The NVA and VC are known to use booby-traps and IEDs. They have been known to watch HLZ's and have well-trained jungle trackers. It's recommended to avoid trails or areas where it's easy to traverse through.

<br/><font color='#21749c' size='18' face='PuristaBold'>MISSION INTENT</font>
<br/>Saigon needs some eyes and ears on the ground to ascertain whether any enemy are in that valley and what capabilities they have.
<br/>
<br/>Stealthily reconnoiter <marker name='marker_41'>AO Whiskey</marker> which borders with Laos. You are not authorized to cross the border into Laos. Look for any sign of the 1st, 3rd and/or 7th NVA Division/s, as well as any Viet Cong activity. Look for any evidence of way stations, supply areas, ammo caches, NVA trucks or vehicles, etc. Mark the grid coordinates and gather any intel you can collect as evidence of NVA or VC incursion.
<br/>
<br/>This is a reconnaissance mission and air assets will be scarce. You are to only report any enemy positions, compositions and equipment. You are to avoid contact at all times and stay hidden. If you are compromised the best course of action is to break contact and evade.
