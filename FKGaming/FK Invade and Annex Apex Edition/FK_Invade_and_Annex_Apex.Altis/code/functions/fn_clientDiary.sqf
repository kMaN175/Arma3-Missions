		<br />
		<br />1. You MUST be on our Teamspeak server--in the correct channel--and communicable. Exception if TS is down or full.
		<br />
		<br />2. You MUST be a pilot to fly an aircraft.
		<br />	If you are a non-pilot and there are less than 20 players on the server, then you may fly a hummingbird in copilot. 
		<br />	If there are over 20 players, you may fly a hummingbird to a side mission ONLY.

		<br />3. Pilots must not play infantry while in a pilot slot.

		<br />4a. If you are an inexperienced pilot, please consider the time and enjoyment of others. The editor is there for a reason.
		<br /> 
		<br />4b. This is a public server. Helicopters are not private/reserved transport. A Pilots primary role is to provide timely general transport to and from objectives.
		<br /> 
		<br />-		* General transport in this context is defined as: Indiscriminate and timely transport for each and all players on the server.
		<br />
		<br />5. You must be able to fly AND LAND any aircraft with reasonable competence, if you do not have experience in any aircraft, you may be asked to leave the role.
		<br />		
		<br />6. Landing or slinging objects/vehicles inside of infantry spawn may result in a warning or a kick for first offense.
		<br />
		<br />7. Ramming enemy or intentional crashing may result in a ban without warning, try to preserve assets.
		<br />
		<br />The above rules are subject to discretion of moderators and administrators.
