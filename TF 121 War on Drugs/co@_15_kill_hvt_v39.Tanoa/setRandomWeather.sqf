	Script Title: 	setRandomWeather.sqf
	Version:		0.3 BETA

	This is a bit of a mashup using manage_weather.sqf files from the original Liberation 0.924 mission from [GREUH]zBug and [GREUH]McKeewa. The below code will execute within the mission to add random weather pattern generation making use of the newer selectRandom command (Arma 3 Version:
	1.56) This does not offer parameter selection for servers, the only customization that can be done is within this SQF file. Script is originally intended for accelerated time missions, so if you want to update this run like an actual 24 hour day setup, then you will need to increase the sleep 300; command to an appropriate value. This is a very basic script I am working with to learn scripting for Arma 3. Anyone is welcome to use this as they see fit.

	Instructions:

	1)	Place both SQF files anywhere you see fit, preferrably in the root directory of your mission. Doesn't matter where as long as you path them 			correctly and init.sqf can find them.

	2)	In your init.sqf, make sure to type in the following making note of its order:

		 [] spawn compileFinal preprocessFileLineNumbers "setRandomWeather.sqf";

	3)	Save your init.sqf, load Arma 3, load the mission and test using setTimeMultiplier. You can decrease the "sleep 300;" command to observe the random 		changes more frequently for debugging and testing.

	4)  If you have no bother over FPS issues, continue using script as is. The only FPS controller I put in was the setFog function. Otherwise, to control rain amounts and such, copy and paste the following between lines 51 and 53 :

			        if ( overcast < 0.7 ) then { 2 setRain 0 };

        			if ( overcast >= 0.7 && overcast < 0.9 ) then { 2 setRain 0.2 };

        			if ( overcast >= 0.9 ) then { 2 setRain 0.4 }; // Prevents heavy rain to help with FPS!
*/

if (!isServer) exitWith {};

This will select a random weather pattern from the array. Values: 0 = Sunny, clear skies   1 = Stormy, complete overcast.

	sleep 0.1;

    0 setFog 0; // Sets fog to 0 to help with FPS (remove this line if you want randomized fog. WARNING: MAY BE FPS HEAVY! )

 };

sleep 300; // Rests for 5 minutes real-life time before selecting new weather pattern. For 24 hour day cycles (1 ingame second = 1 real life second) or 				  which ever you prefer, you will want to update this to make sure weather shifts as appropriate.
