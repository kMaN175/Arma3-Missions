Ideas for further development:

1. Ingame role-assignment menu.

- Would allow players to switch roles without aborting to lobby.
- enable use of skipLobby=1; in description.ext
- Players would join the server and skip the lobby/role assignment, spawning directly at base where they could then choose their role/specialization, like pilot/engineer/medic/etc.

2. Commander/HQ role.

- Mix of community-building and scripted systems to implement Commander-generated gameplay and tasks for player groups.

3. More side missions.

- Work on modular side missions.
- Re-working older side missions.

4. AO sub-objectives.

5. SQL Database and further player & mission persistence.

6. Zeus.

- Build up a large number of potential zeus operators in the community, with a goal of 24/7 coverage of Zeus on the server.
