Adding Vehicle Service points

There are some map markers pre-configured to act as specialized vehicle service points, but they are limited in number.

To add more vehicle service points, simply drop down the new Tanks DLC "Repair Depot" asset, 

found under   "Props >> Supplies >> Storage >> Repair depot"  in the EDEN Editor asset browser. Once placed, toggle the "Simple Object" box.

That asset will then act as a service point capable of servicing all classes of vehicle.
