Creating Speed-Limited Areas

File: "code\config\QS_data_speedLimitAreas.sqf"

You can create areas at base (within a few hundred meters of the "Base" marker) where player-driven vehicles will be restricted to 15km/h driving speed.

This is useful for public servers where you may get trolls and griefers attempting to ram people and other vehicles, and this will make it not so fun for them.

To configure these areas, you will need to gather a set of positions in format [X,Y,Z] in the editor, and configure them into the correct file.

There are more instructions in the header of that file.

To gather the points, I prefer to walk around in the editor and simply execute this line in Debug Console:   copyToClipboard str (position player);

The points you gather must, when connected consecutively, form a polygon. So it is best to walk either clockwise or anticlockwise around and gather the points for each speed-restricted area.

If you want to see how they work, load up the Default base layout (parameters), and attempt to drive around on the helipads in the default base.

Creating Vehicle Restricted Areas

File: "code\config\QS_data_baseRestrictedArea.sqf"

Similarly, you can create Vehicle Restricted areas.

Vehicle Restricted areas are areas in which player-controlled vehicles will be deleted if driven. This is useful for infantry spawn position where trolls & griefers may attempt to ram people as they spawn in, or helicopter pilots may think they are clever to land.

These areas are configured similar to speed-limited areas.

The main difference is you can only create one (1) vehicle-restricted area, while you can create several speed-limited areas.
