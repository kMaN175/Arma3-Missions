Anticheat

Compatibility: A3 1.82

I will try to release updates to the anticheat after each main arma patch (1.82, 1.84, 1.86, 1.88, ...) to maintain compatibility with core game data.

If you are using mods or allowing mods to be used besides Blastcore and JSRS, it is advised to disable the anticheat to prevent false positives.

For information on how to configure or personalize the anticheat for your server, private message Quiksilver on the BI forums or on discord.
