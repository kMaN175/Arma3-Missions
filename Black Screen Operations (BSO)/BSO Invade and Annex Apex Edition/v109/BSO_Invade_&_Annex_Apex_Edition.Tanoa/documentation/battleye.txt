BattlEye can help make it harder for cheaters to exploit your server.

At a minimum, use these files:

remoteexec.txt
createvehicle.txt
publicvariable.txt

To go a step further, use this file:

scripts.txt 

(note, you will have to spend time configuring this file, as well as be familiar with Regex or using a regex generator)

-----

Google search for where to copy the above files to.

The files are available in the Github here:

https://github.com/auQuiksilver/Apex-Framework/tree/master/BattlEye

With a template for scripts.txt here:
