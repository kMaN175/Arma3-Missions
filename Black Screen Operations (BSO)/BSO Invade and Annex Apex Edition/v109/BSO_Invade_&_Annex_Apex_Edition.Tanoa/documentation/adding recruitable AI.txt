1. In the editor, create a friendly AI unit at the position and orientation you would like it to respawn on land.

2. Add the below to the init field:

	0 = [
		this,
		60,
		false,
		{},
		-1,
		FALSE
	] call QS_fnc_registerUnit;


3. Now again, with explanations for what it all means.

	0 = [
		this,	//----- Dont edit this, this is the entity for use by the framework.
		60,	//----- Respawn delay (in seconds). How long after the unit dies before it respawns again?
		false,	//----- TRUE/FALSE. Is the unit type randomized?
		{},	//----- Custom init code executed on this respawning unit only.
		-1,	//----- (number > 0). Respawn tickets.
		FALSE	//----- Is this unit subject to player count restrictions? If true, this unit will not spawn once player count gets above a threshold. If false, it will always respawn.
	] call QS_fnc_registerUnit;
