Switching between the Default base layout and Custom base layout.

1. For default base layout.

- In the folder "SQM\default\<terrain>", copy the "mission.sqm" file.
- Go back to main mission directory and replace the existing mission.SQM file with that.
- If you've worked on a Custom base layout for the existing mission.SQM, copy and paste that file into the "SQM\custom\<terrain>" folder. Feel free to rename things, these files are for storage.

2. For the Custom base layout.

- In the folder "SQM\custom\<terrain>", copy the "mission.sqm" file.
- Go back to main mission directory and replace the existing mission.SQM file with that.
- The custom files there have the required markers and mission objects already spawned in the editor, with example code in the init field of some objects.
