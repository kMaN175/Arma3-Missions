1. Editing AI skill.

2. find the file "code\functions\fn_serverSetAISkill.sqf"

3. The skills are split in two, one set for Tanoa, one set for Malden/Altis/other.

3. _skillLevel 1 and 2 are most-used and are the ones to edit to your liking, for both sets (Tanoa + other).

4. Focus on spotDistance and aimingAccuracy and aimingSpeed subskills.

5. Here is an example of the Altis _skillLevel 1

	if (_skillLevel isEqualTo 1) then {
		_aimingAccuracy = 	[_aimingAccuracyDefault,0.12] select ((random 1) > 0.5);
		_aimingShake = 		random [0.55,0.6,0.65];
		_aimingSpeed = 		random [0.35,0.4,0.45];
		_commanding = 		random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_courage = 			random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_endurance = 		random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_general = 			random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_reloadSpeed = 		random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_spotDistance = 	random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_spotTime = 		random [0.45,0.5,0.55];
		_fleeing = 			0;
	};


6. random [1,2,3] format creates a gaussian distribution (bell curve), with higher probability near the center.

7. Spot distance on Altis (and open terrains) should be higher than spot distance on Tanoa. Accuracy should also be higher on Altis where engagement ranges are longer.

8. _skillLevel 4 is used for anti-air (ZSU-39 Tigris) and also enemy snipers.
